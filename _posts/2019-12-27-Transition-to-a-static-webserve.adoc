= Transition to a static webserve
My blog does not reequire so much controls. PHP, SQL database,... are near useless for my needs. So, I switch to a static website. 
I use HubPress to power my website. It looks simple... but it request an adaptation time before. The global use of the website is quite different than a Wordpress page.

Here, I need to build my pages while previously PHP builds my pages at each calls (not exactly, this is why there is some temporary storage). 
At the time being, I host this site on Github and Netlify. It gives me some time before a switch to my official websites.
